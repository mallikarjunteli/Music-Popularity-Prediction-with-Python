# Music-Popularity-Prediction-with-Python
Music popularity prediction uses regression techniques to forecast a song's future performance based on features and metadata, helping producers, artists, and marketers make informed decisions.



step-by-step explanation of predicting music popularity using machine learning techniques in Python:

### Step-by-Step Explanation

#### 1. Import Libraries and Load Data

First, we import necessary libraries such as `pandas` for data manipulation and `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for data visualization. We load our dataset (`Spotify_data.csv`) into a Pandas DataFrame (`spotify_data`) using `pd.read_csv()`.

#### 2. Drop Unnecessary Column

If there are any unnecessary columns like an unnamed index column, we drop it from the DataFrame (`spotify_data`) using `drop(columns=['ColumnName'], inplace=True)`.

#### 3. Check Data Info

We use `spotify_data.info()` to get an overview of the dataset, which includes the number of entries, data types of columns, and any missing values. This helps us understand the structure of our data.

#### 4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

##### Visualizing Relationship Between Features and Popularity

Using scatter plots (`sns.scatterplot()`), we visualize the relationship between selected music features (e.g., `Energy`, `Valence`, `Danceability`, `Loudness`, `Acousticness`) and the target variable (`Popularity`). This helps us understand how each feature correlates with music popularity.

#### 5. Correlation Matrix

We create a correlation matrix (`corr_matrix`) to quantify and visualize the relationships between all numerical features (`Energy`, `Valence`, `Danceability`, `Loudness`, `Acousticness`, etc.) and `Popularity`. This heatmap helps us identify which features are most strongly correlated with music popularity.

#### 6. Feature Distribution

We plot histograms (`sns.histplot()`) to visualize the distribution of each selected feature (`Energy`, `Valence`, `Danceability`, `Loudness`, `Acousticness`). These plots show us the frequency and spread of values within each feature, aiding in understanding their distribution.

#### 7. Model Training

##### Select Features and Split Data

We select the relevant features (`X`) and the target variable (`y`) from our dataset. Then, we split the data into training (`X_train`, `y_train`) and testing (`X_test`, `y_test`) sets using `train_test_split()`.

##### Normalize Features and Define Model Parameters

Before training our model, we normalize (scale) the features using `StandardScaler()` to ensure all features are on the same scale. We also define a parameter grid (`param_grid`) for hyperparameter tuning of our machine learning model.

##### Perform Grid Search with Cross-Validation

We use `GridSearchCV()` to perform grid search with cross-validation (`cv=5`) to find the best combination of hyperparameters for our model. This helps optimize the model's performance and generalize well on unseen data.

##### Evaluate Model and Make Predictions

After training the model on the training set (`X_train_scaled`, `y_train`), we use the best model (`best_rf_model`) to make predictions on the test set (`X_test_scaled`). Predicted values (`y_pred_best_rf`) are evaluated against actual values (`y_test`) using metrics like Mean Squared Error (`mean_squared_error`) and R-squared (`r2_score`).

#### 8. Visualize Predictions

Finally, we visualize the predicted versus actual values (`y_pred_best_rf` vs `y_test`) using a scatter plot (`plt.scatter()`). The diagonal line (`y=x`) represents perfect predictions, helping us assess how well our model predicts music popularity.

### Summary

This step-by-step process demonstrates how to use Python and machine learning techniques to predict music popularity. By preprocessing data, performing exploratory data analysis, selecting features, training a model, and evaluating its performance, we can gain insights into music preferences and improve recommendation systems on music streaming platforms.
